## Hello, hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Antonio**! A software developer based in the beautiful city of Innsbruck.
Until now I have worked on numerous web & mobile applications, UI libraries with strict accessibility requirements. Also, I have built a few data-migration scripts and CMS modules. 

Programming language that I'm skilled in (and enjoy ðŸ˜„) the most is **JavaScript/TypeScript**. I also have experience with **Java** but I started leaning towards JavaScript more and more. 
Lately, **Angular** is the framework I work with the most with but **React** and **Vue.js** are not strangers either.

I also love working on the Back-End, especially with **Nest.js**. One of my first frameworks that I learned was **Spring** but I haven't really touched it for a while.

In one of previous companies that I worked in, I had a chance to do a project involving mobile programming in **React Native** which I found very interesting.

Want to talk about programming or maybe want to hire me for a project?

Feel free to ping me on social media anytime!
